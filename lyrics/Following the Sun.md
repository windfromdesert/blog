Lyric:


```
Maybe I don’t wanna know
The way home
taking on a journey, I’ve got places to go
Wanna chase a miracle?
It’s possible,
You just gotta open the door
Darling it’s cold out there
Don’t fear the road just
Come along with me
You’re not alone out there
Let’s write a song make up the melody
If you’re looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heart beat
I don’t look behind me
Following the sun
Come and give your love away
don’t play it safe
I’ma let you fall but i won’t let you break
Wanna chase a sunset,
Are You ready yet?
We won’t get this chance every day
Darling it’s cold out there
Don’t fear the road just
Come along with me
You’re not alone out there
Let’s write a song make up the melody
If you’re looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heart beat
I don’t look behind me
Following the sun
You can lean on...
You can lean on me
You can lean on...
You can lean on me
If you’re looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heart beat
I don’t look behind me
Following the sun
